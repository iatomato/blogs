## The **Rust** Programming Language

> Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))

## Syntax: Hello World

档案名: main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
编译程式源码与执行，与 C\C++ 的方式相同，（Thanks God，不是 XVM
```cmd
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```
