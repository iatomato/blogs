### Installing on Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux

> sudo yum install httpd
> 
> sudo systemctl enable httpd
> 
> sudo systemctl start httpd
> 
> Newer releases of these distros use dnf rather than yum. See the Fedora project's documentation for platform-specific notes.

### Installing on Ubuntu/Debian

> sudo apt install apache2
> 
> sudo service apache2 start

### Installing from source

#### Before

APR APR-UTIL

> Make sure you have APR and APR-Util already installed on your system. If you don't, or prefer to not use the system-provided versions, download the latest versions of both APR and APR-Util from Apache APR, **unpack them into /httpd_source_tree_root/srclib/apr and /httpd_source_tree_root/srclib/apr-util** (be sure the directory names do not have version numbers; for example, the APR distribution must be under /httpd_source_tree_root/srclib/apr/) and use ./configure's --with-included-apr option. On some platforms, you may have to install the corresponding -dev packages to allow httpd to build against your installed copy of APR and APR-Util.
