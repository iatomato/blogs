**Pointer to Pointer Is Not A Good**

`char *m` is a pointer of char to char. So, nah, It's can, we can modify it.
> will place "Hello world" in the read-only parts of the memory, and making s a pointer to that makes any writing operation on this memory illegal.

```c
void n_str(char *str)
{
	printf("%s\n", *(str + 0));
}
```
这里会编译报错
```cmd
mstr.c:16:11: warning: format ‘%s’ expects argument of type ‘char *’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’ [-Wformat=]
   16 |  printf("%s\n", *(str + 0));
       |         ~^     ~~~~~~~~~~
       |          |     |
       |          |     int
       |          char *
       |         %d
```
如果我们换成 '%d' 又会发生什么呢，没错一定会编译过
```c
void n_str(char *str)
{
	printf("%d\n", *(str + 0));
}
```
