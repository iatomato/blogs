## typedef?
> typedef is a reserved keyword in the programming languages C and C++. It is used to create an additional name for another data type, 
> but does not create a new type, except in the obscure case of a qualified typedef of an array type where the typedef qualifiers are 
> transferred to the array element type. [Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjKu_HE1PvwAhVOGVkFHX_6AeEQmhMwJXoECB8QAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTypedef&usg=AOvVaw0G3T1vvGEUSfJX4MrTJLId)

## struct?
> A struct in the C programming language is a composite data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables
> under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared
> name which returns the same address. [Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiXqKvp1PvwAhVRKVkFHSCPDsgQmhMwIXoECCMQAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStruct_(C_programming_language)&usg=AOvVaw1VjU1hOiQuFfl9nq7t-0H-)

### Examples

`typedef`
```c
typedef void (*self);      // now self is a keyword, meaning it's a void pointer
typedef unsigned int uint; // uint is keyword, it's unsigned int
```

`typedef` + `struct`
```c
typedef struct server server_t;
           |____| |______|
             |        |
             |  server server_t it's like struct server_t
         server is keyword of a type to struct
```
