> <b>**Introduction**</b>
>
> Domain Name Service (DNS) is an Internet service that maps IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDN) to one another. In this way, DNS alleviates the need to remember IP addresses. Computers that run DNS are called name servers. Ubuntu ships with BIND (Berkley Internet Naming Daemon), the most widely deployed DNS server.
>
> This guide is aimed at people looking to learn how to configure and maintain a DNS server, such as for a network (caching name server) or to serve DNS zones for a domain name. 

### Installation

At a terminal prompt, enter the following command to install dns:

```
~$ sudo apt install bind9
```

The DNS configuration files are stored in the /etc/bind directory. The primary configuration file is /etc/bind/named.conf, which in the layout provided by the package just includes these files.

  - /etc/bind/named.conf.options: global DNS options
  - /etc/bind/named.conf.local: for your zones
  - /etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones: default zones such as localhost, its reverse, and the root hints

### Primary Server

In this section BIND9 will be configured as the Primary server for the domain example.com. Simply replace example.com with your FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

#### Forward Zone File

To add a DNS zone to BIND9, turning BIND9 into a Primary server, first edit /etc/bind/named.conf.local:

```
zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.dev.com";
};
```

Now use an existing zone file as a template to create the /etc/bind/db.dev.com file:

```
~$ sudo cp /etc/bind/db.local /etc/bind/db.dev.com
```

Edit the new zone file /etc/bind/db.example.com and change localhost. to the FQDN ([A fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)) of your server, leaving the additional . at the end. Change 127.0.0.1 to the nameserverâ€™s IP Address and root.localhost to a valid email address, but with a . instead of the usual @ symbol, again leaving the . at the end. Change the comment to indicate the domain that this file is for.

> **Note**
>
> If bind will be receiving automatic updates to the file as with DDNS, then use /var/lib/bind/db.example.com rather than /etc/bind/db.example.com both here and in the copy command below.
