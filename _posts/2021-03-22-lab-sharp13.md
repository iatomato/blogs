> <b>**BIND9 Configuration Scenarios**</b>
>
> BIND9 can provide many different DNS services.

> <b>Introduction</b>
>
> Domain Name Service (DNS) is an Internet service that maps IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDN) to one another. In this way, DNS alleviates the need to remember IP addresses. Computers that run DNS are called name servers. Ubuntu ships with BIND (Berkley Internet Naming Daemon), the most widely deployed DNS server.
>
> This guide is aimed at people looking to learn how to configure and maintain a DNS server, such as for a network (caching name server) or to serve DNS zones for a domain name.
