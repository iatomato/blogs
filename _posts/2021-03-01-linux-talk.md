不持有争议，大部分人们把 Linux 称为操作系统，因 为 大 多 数 人 称 为 `操作系统`，这里没有贬低的意思。挖字面意思或许就没什么意思了。

*Linux 是内核还是操作系统 ?*

> [Operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)
> An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

> FOSS [Linux](https://www.fosslinux.com/42926/is-linux-an-operating-system-or-a-kernel.htm#:~:text=Linux%2C%20in%20its%20nature%2C%20is,one%20year%20after%20it's%20creation.)
> Linux, in its nature, is not an operating system; it’s a Kernel. The Kernel is part of the operating system – And the most crucial. For it to be an OS, it is supplied with GNU software and other additions giving us the name GNU/Linux.
