`m_str.c`
```c
void m_str(char *, int);
void lm_str(char **);

int main()
{
    char n[5] = "whats";
    char *m = "whats";
    return 0;
}

void m_str(char *string, int size)
{
    *(string + 0) = 'W'; /* (string + 0) -> pointer to n[0] */
    ...
}

void lm_str(char **string)
{
    *string = "WHATS";
}
```
`char *m` is a pointer of char to char<br>
So, nah, It's can
> will place "Hello world" in the read-only parts of the memory, and making s a pointer to that makes any writing operation on this memory illegal.
