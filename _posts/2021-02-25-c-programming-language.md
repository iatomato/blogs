"What's Programming language best?"<br>
I know many people have asked this question.<br>
Yes, it's a stupid question.<br>
<hr>
<br>
Open terminal or other terminal, type it.
{% highlight bash %}
vim hello.c
{% endhighlight %}
<br>
{% highlight c %}
#include <studio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argc[])
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Yep, it's just my thoughts, why I like C.
